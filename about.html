            <h2>About UniRank.one</h2>
            <p>This website started from a personal need. While searching for PhD and research positions, I constantly found myself diving into university rankings. I noticed a recurring issue: most ranking websites were cluttered and hard to navigate. I needed something simpler, a place where I could find clear and plain information quickly.</p>
            <p>So, I decided to build UniRank.one. My aim was to create a user-friendly site that stripped away the complexity and presented the essential data in an easily digestible format. I began with the QS 2024 rankings as a base for the top 300 universities. To add more depth, I included corresponding ranks from other renowned lists, ensuring a comprehensive overview. Here's how I sourced the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>QS Rankings:</strong> Directly from the official Excel file provided on their website.</li>
                <li><strong>Times Higher Education Rankings:</strong> Times Higher Education Rankings for 2024 were copied from the official website.</li>
                <li><strong>ARWU Rankings:</strong> ARWU rankings for 2023 were obtained using webscraping</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope UniRank.one helps you as much as it has helped me in making informed decisions about universities.</p>
            <p>Please note, all information on this site has been sourced from the respective owners mentioned above. If you're the owner of any of these rankings and wish to have your data removed from my website, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
            <p>Happy university hunting!</p>

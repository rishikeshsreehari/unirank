            <h2>About UniRank.one</h2>
            <p>This website started from a personal need. While searching for PhD and research positions, I constantly found myself diving into university rankings. I noticed a recurring issue: most ranking websites were cluttered and hard to navigate. I needed something simpler, a place where I could find clear and plain information quickly.</p>
            <p>So, I decided to build <a href="https://unirank.one">UniRank.one</a>. </p>
         
            <p>My aim was to create a user-friendly site that stripped away the complexity and presented the essential data in an easily digestible format from the three longest established and most influential global rankings namely; <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings"> Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)</a>,<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/"> Times Higher Education (THE)</a> and <a href="https://www.shanghairanking.com/">Shanghai Ranking Consultancy </a>(the Academic Ranking of World Universities; ARWU).I began with the QS 2024 rankings as a base for the top 300 universities. 
             With QS as the base for 300 universities, the corresponding rankings from THE and AWRU were compiled. Compiling the ranks from these 3 sources were a tricky affair because the names of universities were not uniform across various rankings and some universities were missing from some rankings(these are marked as ''N/A' in the table)</p> 
                
        
            <p>I hope UniRank.one helps you as much as it has helped me in making informed decisions about universities.</p>
            <p>Happy university hunting!</p>
